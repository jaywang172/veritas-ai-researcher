## 摘要 (Abstract)
This paper examines the intricate relationship between renewable energy and climate change, highlighting the transformative potential of renewables in mitigating climate-related impacts. It acknowledges the vulnerabilities of renewable energy systems to climate-induced phenomena, such as extreme weather events, while emphasizing the importance of a diversified energy portfolio for resilience. The paper proposes strategic approaches to enhance the reliability and sustainability of renewable energy in the face of climate variability, including the integration of weather and climate insights into energy system design. The overarching message is that proactive, adaptive strategies are essential to ensure the successful transition to a sustainable energy future.

## 1. Introduction: The Potential of Renewable Energy
Renewable energy stands at the forefront of strategies to combat climate change, with the potential to supply a significant portion of global electricity by the mid-21st century. This transition extends beyond energy production, targeting the broader goal of climate change mitigation by displacing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. The integration of renewable energy is thus pivotal for a sustainable future.

## 2. The Impact of Climate Change on Renewable Energy
The interplay between climate change and renewable energy is complex, with environmental changes affecting the performance of renewable sources. While some sources like geothermal energy exhibit resilience, others are more susceptible to climate impacts. This paradox, where renewables are both a solution to and affected by climate change, necessitates adaptive strategies to enhance their resilience.

## 3. Strategies for Mitigating Climate Impact on Renewable Energy
To mitigate climate impact on renewable energy, diversification of energy portfolios and the incorporation of climate insights into energy system design are crucial. These strategies aim to bolster the reliability and resilience of renewable energy infrastructures, ensuring energy security and sustainability despite climate challenges.
